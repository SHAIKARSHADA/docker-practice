# Docker 

## to learn in more depth go to dailycode.100xdevs.com/tracks/docker-2

#### i.e auxiliary servies means postgresql, mongodb, or database to be exact 

## what we will learn if we have learnt docker

1. Kubernetes / Container orchestration
2. Running Processes in isolated environments
3. Starting Project / auxiliary services locally


## Containerization

* Think of it like an small machine running in an big machine like mac or pc.
*  They allow you to package an application, along with all its dependencies and libraries, into a single unit that can be run on any machine with a container runtime, such as Docker.

### Why containers

* Everyone has different Operating systems
* steps to run a project can vary based on OS
* Extremely harder to keep track of dependencies as project grows

### Benefits of using containers
 
* Let you describe your configuration in a single file
* Can run in isolated environments
* Makes Local setup of OS projects a breeze
* Makes installing auxiliary services/DBs easy

## Docker Engine
Docker Engine is an open-source containerization technology that allows developers to package applications into container
Containers are standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Docker CLI
The command line interface lets you talk to the docker engine and lets you start/stop/list containers
> docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
Docker cli is not the only way to talk to a docker engine. You can hit the docker REST API to do the same things

## Docker registry

The docker registry is how Docker makes money. 
It is similar to github, but it lets you push images rather than sourcecode
Dockerâ€™s main registry - https://dockerhub.com/
Mongo image on docker registry - https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo

## Docker Image
* A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.
* ðŸ’¡ A good mental model for an image is Your codebase on github
 
## Docker Container
* A container is a running instance of an image. It encapsulates the application or service and its dependencies, running in an isolated environment.
* ðŸ’¡ A good mental model for a container is when you run node index.js on your machine from some source code you got from github

## port mapping
 ### docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo
* Port mapping is an way to describe an tell that in this localhost:27017 run the docker image of mongo
* The first one tell that mac machines this port, pls go to this port after colon

## 8 - Common docker commands
* docker images
* docker ps
* docker run
* docker build

1. docker images
Shows you all the images that you have on your machine

2. docker ps
Shows you all the containers you are running on your machine

3. docker run
Lets you start a container
-p â‡’ letâ€™s you create a port mapping
-d. â‡’ Letâ€™s you run it in detatched mode

4. docker build
Lets you build an image. We will see this after we understand how to create your own Dockerfile

5. docker push
Lets you push your image to a registry

6. Extra commands
docker kill
docker exec
docker rmi image-name ( to remove an docker image from your mac machine)


## What is a Dockerfile
* If you want to create an image from your own code, that you can push to dockerhub, you need to create a Dockerfile for your application.
* A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to create an image.

### How to write a dockerfile
* A dockerfile has 2 parts
1. Base image
2. Bunch of commands that you run on the base image (to install dependencies like Node.js)

## Common commands
* WORKDIR: Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPYinstructions that follow it.
* RUN: Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results.
* CMD: Provides defaults for executing a container. There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile.
* EXPOSE: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
* ENV: Sets the environment variable.
* COPY: Allow files from the Docker host to be added to the Docker image

## Now that you have a dockerfile in your project, try building a docker image from it
> docker build -t image_name .

 
## Now if you try to look at your images, you should notice a new image created
> docker images

 
* ðŸ’¡Add a .dockerignore so that node_modules donâ€™t get copied over 

## Running images
> docker run -p 3000:3000 image_name

* Try visiting localhost:3000

## 12 - Passing in env variables
> docker run -p 3000:3000 -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://avnadmind.com:25579/defaultdb?sslmode=require" image_name
 
* The -e argument letâ€™s you send in environment variables to your node.js app

## More commands
* docker kill - to kill a container
* docker exec - to exectue a command inside a container
 
1. List all contents of a container folder
> docker exec <container_name_or_id> ls /path/to/directory

2. Running an Interactive Shell
> docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
